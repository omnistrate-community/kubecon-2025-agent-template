## Omnistrate Agent Instructions

## Available Skills

### Onboarding Services to Omnistrate
**Location**: `.claude/skills/omnistrate-fde/`

Guide users through onboarding applications onto the Omnistrate platform. Currently supports Docker Compose-based services with full deployment lifecycle management. **CRITICAL**: ALWAYS starts with ZERO parameterization (hardcoded values) to ensure successful initial deployment, then adds API parameters incrementally ONLY when user explicitly requests customization.

**When to use**:
- Onboarding applications to Omnistrate platform
- Creating SaaS offerings with multi-tenant infrastructure
- Transforming Docker Compose files into Omnistrate service definitions
- Setting up customer-facing service catalogs

**Supported methods**:
- Docker Compose (fully supported)
- Helm, Terraform, Kustomize, Kubernetes Operators (planned - direct users to https://docs.omnistrate.com/getting-started/overview/)

**Key capabilities**:
- Compose spec transformation with validation
- Zero-parameterization initial builds (hardcoded defaults)
- Incremental API parameter addition (ONLY when user requests)
- Compute and storage resource setup
- Iterative debugging until instances are RUNNING
- Multi-service architecture with synthetic root patterns

### Debugging Omnistrate Deployments
**Location**: `.claude/skills/omnistrate-sre/`

Systematically debug failed Omnistrate instance deployments using a progressive workflow that identifies root causes efficiently while avoiding token limits.

**When to use**:
- Instance deployments showing FAILED or DEPLOYING status
- Resources with unhealthy pod statuses or deployment errors
- Startup/readiness probe failures (HTTP 503, timeouts)
- Helm releases with unclear deployment states
- Need to identify root cause of deployment failures

**Key capabilities**:
- Progressive debugging workflow (status → workflows → events → logs)
- Pod-level investigation with kubectl
- Helm-specific verification
- Common failure pattern recognition
- Infrastructure and application-level analysis

### Omnistrate Solutions Architect
**Location**: `.claude/skills/omnistrate-sa/`

Guide users through designing application architectures from scratch for SaaS deployment on Omnistrate. Focuses on technology selection, domain-specific patterns, compliance/SLA requirements, and iterative Docker Compose development. Handles transition from local development (with build contexts) to cloud deployment (with image registries). Output is a production-ready vanilla compose spec (without `x-omnistrate-*` extensions) that can be handed off to the FDE skill for Omnistrate-native transformation.

**When to use**:
- Designing new SaaS applications from scratch and choosing technology stacks
- Selecting databases, frameworks, caches, message queues for specific domains
- Understanding domain-specific requirements (AI/ML, analytics, APIs, data platforms)
- Evaluating compliance needs (SOC2, HIPAA, GDPR, data residency)
- Determining customer SLA requirements and availability architecture
- Making architectural decisions informed by Omnistrate's tenancy and deployment models
- Iteratively developing and validating Docker Compose specifications
- **User has a compose file with `build:` contexts** (needs conversion to `image:` references)
- **Compose file only works locally** (needs registry setup for cloud deployment)
- Converting local compose specs (with build contexts) to cloud-ready specs (with image registries)
- Preparing compose specs for FDE skill transformation

**Do NOT use when**:
- User already has a complete compose spec with ALL services using `image:` references (no `build:` contexts) AND images are in accessible registries → Use **FDE skill** instead
- User needs to debug failed deployments → Use **SRE skill** instead

**Key capabilities**:
- Technology stack selection (frameworks, databases, caches, queues, storage)
- Domain-specific architecture patterns (API, ML, analytics, data platforms)
- Tenancy model design (shared, siloed, hybrid) informed by Omnistrate capabilities
- Deployment model planning (SaaS, BYOC, BYOC Copilot, On-Premise)
- Compliance and security architecture (SOC2, HIPAA, GDPR, PCI)
- SLA-driven availability design (99.9% to 99.999% uptime)
- Iterative Docker Compose spec development and validation
- Container image registry setup (convert build contexts to image references)
- Private registry authentication configuration (x-omnistrate-image-registry-attributes)
- Omnistrate-aware design decisions (autoscaling, backups, multi-zone readiness)
